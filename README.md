## **Math Algorithms**

### **Factorial**

(Implement with and without recursion)

1) Given "n", find its factorial. Assume all inputs are natural numbers. Factorial of 0 is 1. i.e. 4's factorial would be the product of [1,2,3,4], 24

*Aim for O(n): linear*

### **Fibonacci Sequence** 

1) Given a value "n", find all values from index 0 until "n" in the fibonacci sequence. i.e. 7 should return [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]

*Aim for O(n): linear*

2) Find the value at index "n" in the fibonacci sequence. i.e. 3 should return [0,1,1,2]

*Aim for O(n): linear*

### **Power of Two**

1) Given number "n", determine if the value is a power of two. i.e. 1024 should return true

*Aim for O(1): constant (use &, O(n): linear works too)*

## **Search Algorithms**

### **Linear Search**

1) Given array "arr", find the index of target "t". Return -1 if the target is not found. i.e. [1,2,3,4,5] with a target of 4 should return 3

*Aim for O(n): linear*

### **Binary Search**

(Implement with and without recursion)

1) Given a sorted array of "n" elements, find the index of target "t" in the array. Return -1 if the target is not found. i.e. [1,2,3,4,5] with a target of 4 should return 3

*Aim for O(logn): logarithmic*

## **Sorting Algorithms**

### **Bubble Sort**

1) Given an array of numbers, sort the elements in ascending order. i.e. [1,4,2,3,0] should return [0,1,2,3,4]

*Aim for O(n): linear*
