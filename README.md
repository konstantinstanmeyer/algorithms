## **Math Algorithms**

### **Factorial**

(Implement with and without recursion)

1) Given "n", find its factorial. Assume all inputs are natural numbers. i.e. 4's factorial would be the product of [1,2,3,4], 24

*Aim for O(n): linear*

### **Fibonacci Sequence**

1) Given a value "n", find all values from index 0 until "n" in the fibonacci sequence i.e. 7 should return [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]

*Aim for O(n): linear*

2) Find the value at index "n" in the fibonacci sequence i.e. 3 should return [0,1,1,2]

*Aim for O(n): linear*

## **Search Algorithms**

### **Linear Search**

1) Given array "arr", find the index of target "t" i.e. [1,2,3,4,5] with a target of 4 should return 3

*Aim for O(n): linear*
